# Bellabeat Case Study
##### SQL and Data Viz

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## Data Source
FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CCO: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius).
THe description provided for this data set was: 
    "This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences."

HOWEVER, diving into the data set provided later revealed that the data set only contained data tracked from April 12 - May 12, 2016. Another issue with the data set was that 33 distinct IDs were found which suggested that the information came from 33 users instead of the stated 30 users.
